    "summary": "These remarks were delivered by World            Bank Group President Ajay Banga on October 23, 2024,            highlighted the potential of agribusiness in food security,            growth, and employment at the \"Agriculture and Food as            an Engine of Sustainable Growth and Jobs\" event. He            identified four key shifts: the need for climate-smart            agriculture, new financial tools for derisking,            digitalization to connect farmers with financial services,            and the role of farmer associations in overcoming financing            inefficiencies. He announced a strategic pivot to create a            comprehensive agribusiness ecosystem, doubling commitments            to $9 billion annually by 2030, integrating public and            private sector efforts, and focusing on regulations,            standards, and climate finance. He said that this initiative            aims to address the employment needs of 1.2 billion young            people in developing countries, improve quality of life, and            build resilient communities through a thriving agriculture industry.",

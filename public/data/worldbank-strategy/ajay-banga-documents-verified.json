    "content": "These remarks were delivered by World Bank Group President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment Summit on Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE on December 2, 2023. He started by mentioning about how Methane is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in warming the planet, making it a major driver of climate change. He said that the frontier of methane reduction is one such area where the World Bank believes there are answers at their fingertips, and that is why the World Bank is taking action, scaling proven &#x2013; and urgently needed &#x2013; strategies that can decisively bend the methane emission curve. He mentioned that over the following eighteen months, as part of a blueprint for methane reduction, World Bank will help launch fifteen national programs that aim to slash methane emissions. He also added that the World Bank has been working with Germany, Norway, the United States, and the UAE alongside the private sector to expand our long-standing efforts to significantly cut methane emissions across the whole energy value chain. He highlighted on Methane is one rare, clear area where we know there are low-cost remedies, effective and simple solutions that can be replicated and scaled. He concluded by saying, we must act, and in doing so we can reduce emissions, enhance agricultural yields, and improve health outcomes all in one go. These remarks were delivered by World Bank Group President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment Summit on Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE on December 2, 2023. He started by mentioning about how Methane is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in warming the planet, making it a major driver of climate change. He said that the frontier of methane reduction is one such area where the World Bank believes there are answers at their fingertips, and that is why the World Bank is taking action, scaling proven &#x2013; and urgently needed &#x2013; strategies that can decisively bend the methane emission curve. He mentioned that over the following eighteen months, as part of a blueprint for methane reduction, World Bank will help launch fifteen national programs that aim to slash methane emissions.

    "content": "These were the remarks delivered by World Bank Group President Ajay Banga at the COP28 Climate Finance Event on December 1, 2023. He spoke about the resources of wealthy nations can create opportunities, meanwhile the abundance of sun, wind, fertile soil, and young people enjoyed by emerging economies could drive our future. We have inherited decades of knowledge and benefitted from the generosity of every nation, now we are being called upon to lead, and we have never been better positioned to deliver the progress that is demanded. Today, the World Bank is setting an ambitious goal to devote 45 percent of our annual financing to climate by 2025. We&#x2019;re putting our ambition in overdrive and putting to work more than 40 billion dollars per year, around 9 billion dollars more than the original target. Making certain IBRD and IDA resources are deployed equally for mitigation and adaptation, because while we all are experiencing climate change, we are feeling the effects differently. Over the next few days, the World Bank will detail a blueprint for slashing methane emissions, announce a roadmap for high integrity carbon markets, discuss progress on our Private Sector Investment Lab, and outline efforts to deepen the collective impact of multilateral development banks.

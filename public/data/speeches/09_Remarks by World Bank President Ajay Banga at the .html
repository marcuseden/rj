             <p>The world is much different than it was when the World Bank was founded.</p><p>We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling pandemic recovery, widening disparity, and a crippling war on the borders of Europe.</p><p>All intertwined.</p><p>The remarkable <a href="https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf">G20 New Delhi Declaration</a>, which I congratulate Prime Minister Modi and all G20 Members on, puts the World Bank at the center of our search for solutions.</p><p>We were built to take on difficult challenges.</p><p>But to truly make a difference, we will need a greater appetite for risk, meaningful private sector financing, and… a sense of urgency.</p><p>This urgency motivates us to write a new playbook that will drive impactful development.</p><p>Our challenges don’t respect lines on a map. And if we fail to work together – we all lose.</p><p>To respond, under the umbrella of our Evolution Roadmap, we are becoming a better Bank.</p><p>We are becoming more efficient – incentivizing output, not input. Keeping focus on how many girls are in school, jobs created, and private sector dollars mobilized.</p><p>Impact is our new measuring stick.</p><p>At your urging, we are digging deep to boost our lending capacity, but we are going further, creating new mechanisms that would allow us to do even more.</p><p>We’re working to expand concessional financing to help more low-income countries achieve their goals, while thinking creatively about how to encourage cooperation across borders and tackle shared challenges.</p><p>This progress is important, but it is not the end of our journey.</p><p>After we deliver a better bank, we will need a bigger Bank. Bigger than what the capital adequacy framework will produce by itself.</p><p>As we face a new era in development, we remain committed to creating a world free of poverty on a livable planet.</p>

He extended his condolences to Tanzania and the\n            communities impacted in the floods a few days ago. He\n            assured that the World Bank will be by their side during the\n            recovery and reconstruction. He spoke about the founding of\n            International Development Association, charged with a simple\n            yet noble mission to raise standards of living and build\n            momentum for growth in developing countries. He questioned\n            on how can we hope to make even adequate progress while 600\n            million people in Africa &#x2013; 36 million of whom\n            live here in Tanzania still don&#x2019;t have access to\n            reliable electricity? He cited the example from town in\n            Nigeria where IDA had helped fund a mini-grid system, and\n            the electricity it generated allowed small farmers to do\n            their work in half the time, it enabled shop keepers to\n            accept digital payments, and gave diabetics regular access\n            to climate-controlled insulin. He insisted that we must make\n            good on the World Bank&#x2019;s evolution roadmap and\n            make IDA more approachable, accessible, and understandable.\n            He highlighted that together we will reimagine what IDA\n            could become and what we could achieve as a result. He\n            concluded by saying that we will have the opportunity to\n            commit ourselves to the vision that sparked the creation of\n            IDA&#x2014;a vision of a world where poverty is not a\n            barrier to human potential, but a world where every\n            individual has the opportunity to thrive.\n\n\n================================================================================\nSPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group\n            President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment Summit on\n            Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE\nDate: 2023-12-02\nLocation: N/A\n================================================================================\n\nThese remarks were delivered by World\n            Bank Group President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment\n            Summit on Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE on December 2,\n            2023. He started by mentioning about how Methane is 80 times\n            more powerful than carbon dioxide in warming the planet,\n            making it a major driver of climate change. He said that the\n            frontier of methane reduction is one such area where the\n            World Bank believes there are answers at their fingertips,\n            and that is why the World Bank is taking action, scaling\n            proven &#x2013; and urgently needed &#x2013;\n            strategies that can decisively bend the methane emission\n            curve. He mentioned that over the following eighteen months,\n            as part of a blueprint for methane reduction, World Bank\n            will help launch fifteen national programs that aim to slash\n            methane emissions. He also added that the World Bank has\n            been working with Germany, Norway, the United States, and\n            the UAE alongside the private sector to expand our\n            long-standing efforts to significantly cut methane emissions\n            across the whole energy value chain. He highlighted on\n            Methane is one rare, clear area where we know there are\n            low-cost remedies, effective and simple solutions that can\n            be replicated and scaled. He concluded by saying, we must\n            act, and in doing so we can reduce emissions, enhance\n            agricultural yields, and improve health outcomes all in one go.\n\n\n================================================================================\nSPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group\n            President Ajay Banga at Transforming Climate Finance Event, COP28\nDate: 2023-12-01\nLocation: N/A\n================================================================================\n\nThese were the remarks delivered by\n            World Bank Group President Ajay Banga at the COP28 Climate\n            Finance Event on December 1, 2023. He spoke about the\n            resources of wealthy nations can create opportunities,\n            meanwhile the abundance of sun, wind, fertile soil, and\n            young people enjoyed by emerging economies could drive our\n            future. We have inherited decades of knowledge and\n            benefitted from the generosity of every nation, now we are\n            being called upon to lead, and we have never been better\n            positioned to deliver the progress that is demanded. Today,\n            the World Bank is setting an ambitious goal to devote 45\n            percent of our annual financing to climate by 2025.\n            We&#x2019;re putting our ambition in overdrive and\n            putting to work more than 40 billion dollars per year,\n            around 9 billion dollars more than the original target.\n            Making certain IBRD and IDA resources are deployed equally\n            for mitigation and adaptation, because while we all are\n            experiencing climate change, we are feeling the effects\n            differently. Over the next few days, the World Bank will\n            detail a blueprint for slashing methane emissions, announce\n            a roadmap for high integrity carbon markets, discuss\n            progress on our Private Sector Investment Lab, and outline\n            efforts to deepen the collective impact of multilateral\n            development banks.\n\n\n================================================================================\nSPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group\n            President Ajay Banga at the 2023 Annual Meetings Plenary\nDate: 2023-10-17\nLocation: N/A\n================================================================================\n\nThis report discusses the remarks\n            delivered by Ajay Banga, President of the World Bank at the\n            annual meetings plenary. The World Bank stepped forward to\n            support the most vulnerable when compounding challenges: the\n            war in Ukraine, the effects of the pandemic, and\n            inflation-hit. But the need was so great that we allocated\n            the majority of our three-year crisis response window in the\n            first year. Our partnership focuses on three objectives:\n            attack deforestation in the Amazon, strengthen the\n            Caribbean&#x2019;s resilience to natural disasters, and\n            bridge the digital-access gap across Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n\n================================================================================\nSPEECH: Remarks by World Bank President Ajay\n            Banga at the 2023 G20 India Leaders Summit \"One\n            Future\" Session\nDate: 2023-09-10\nLocation: N/A\n================================================================================\n\nThis report discusses the remarks\n            delivered by the World Bank President, Ajay Banga, at the\n            2023 G20 India Leaders Summit \"One Future\" Session\n            held on September 10, 2023. He said that we face declining\n            progress in our fight against poverty, an existential\n            climate crisis, food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling\n            pandemic recovery, widening disparity, and a crippling war\n            on the borders of Europe. He congratulated Prime Minister\n            Modi and all G20 Members on, puts the World Bank at the\n            center of their search for solutions. He mentioned that to\n            truly make a difference, we will need a greater appetite for\n            risk, meaningful private sector financing, and a sense of\n            urgency. He explained that the World Bank is working to\n            expand concessional financing to help more low-income\n            countries achieve their goals, while thinking creatively\n            about how to encourage cooperation across borders and tackle\n            shared challenges. He insisted on keeping focus on how many\n            girls are in school, jobs created, and private sector\n            dollars mobilized. He concluded by saying that, as we face a\n            new era in development, the World Bank remain committed to\n            creating a world free of poverty on a livable planet.\n\n"

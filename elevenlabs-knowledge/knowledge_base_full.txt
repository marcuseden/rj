SPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group
            President Ajay Banga at the International Development
            Association (IDA) Midterm Review
Date: 2023-12-06
Location: N/A
================================================================================

These remarks were delivered by World
            Bank Group President, Ajay Banga, at the International
            Development Association (IDA) Midterm Review on December 6,
            2023. He extended his condolences to Tanzania and the
            communities impacted in the floods a few days ago. He
            assured that the World Bank will be by their side during the
            recovery and reconstruction. He spoke about the founding of
            International Development Association, charged with a simple
            yet noble mission to raise standards of living and build
            momentum for growth in developing countries. He questioned
            on how can we hope to make even adequate progress while 600
            million people in Africa &#x2013; 36 million of whom
            live here in Tanzania still don&#x2019;t have access to
            reliable electricity? He cited the example from town in
            Nigeria where IDA had helped fund a mini-grid system, and
            the electricity it generated allowed small farmers to do
            their work in half the time, it enabled shop keepers to
            accept digital payments, and gave diabetics regular access
            to climate-controlled insulin. He insisted that we must make
            good on the World Bank&#x2019;s evolution roadmap and
            make IDA more approachable, accessible, and understandable.
            He highlighted that together we will reimagine what IDA
            could become and what we could achieve as a result. He
            concluded by saying that we will have the opportunity to
            commit ourselves to the vision that sparked the creation of
            IDA&#x2014;a vision of a world where poverty is not a
            barrier to human potential, but a world where every
            individual has the opportunity to thrive.

SPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group
            President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment Summit on
            Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE
Date: 2023-12-02
Location: N/A
================================================================================

These remarks were delivered by World
            Bank Group President, Ajay Banga at High Level Segment
            Summit on Methane at COP28 in Dubai, UAE on December 2,
            2023. He started by mentioning about how Methane is 80 times
            more powerful than carbon dioxide in warming the planet,
            making it a major driver of climate change. He said that the
            frontier of methane reduction is one such area where the
            World Bank believes there are answers at their fingertips,
            and that is why the World Bank is taking action, scaling
            proven &#x2013; and urgently needed &#x2013;
            strategies that can decisively bend the methane emission
            curve. He mentioned that over the following eighteen months,
            as part of a blueprint for methane reduction, World Bank
            will help launch fifteen national programs that aim to slash
            methane emissions. He also added that the World Bank has
            been working with Germany, Norway, the United States, and
            the UAE alongside the private sector to expand our
            long-standing efforts to significantly cut methane emissions
            across the whole energy value chain. He highlighted on
            Methane is one rare, clear area where we know there are
            low-cost remedies, effective and simple solutions that can
            be replicated and scaled. He concluded by saying, we must
            act, and in doing so we can reduce emissions, enhance
            agricultural yields, and improve health outcomes all in one go.

SPEECH: Remarks by World Bank Group
            President Ajay Banga at Transforming Climate Finance Event, COP28
Date: 2023-12-01
Location: N/A
================================================================================

These were the remarks delivered by
            World Bank Group President Ajay Banga at the COP28 Climate
            Finance Event on December 1, 2023. He spoke about the
            resources of wealthy nations can create opportunities,
            meanwhile the abundance of sun, wind, fertile soil, and
            young people enjoyed by emerging economies could drive our
            future. We have inherited decades of knowledge and
            benefitted from the generosity of every nation, now we are
            being called upon to lead, and we have never been better
            positioned to deliver the progress that is demanded. Today,
            the World Bank is setting an ambitious goal to devote 45
            percent of our annual financing to climate by 2025.
            We&#x2019;re putting our ambition in overdrive and
            putting to work more than 40 billion dollars per year,
            around 9 billion dollars more than the original target.
            Making certain IBRD and IDA resources are deployed equally
            for mitigation and adaptation, because while we all are
            experiencing climate change, we are feeling the effects
            differently. Over the next few days, the World Bank will
            detail a blueprint for slashing methane emissions, announce
            a roadmap for high integrity carbon markets, discuss
            progress on our Private Sector Investment Lab, and outline
            efforts to deepen the collective impact of multilateral
            development banks.

This report discusses the remarks
            delivered by Ajay Banga, President of the World Bank at the
            annual meetings plenary. The World Bank stepped forward to
            support the most vulnerable when compounding challenges: the
            war in Ukraine, the effects of the pandemic, and
            inflation-hit. But the need was so great that we allocated
            the majority of our three-year crisis response window in the
            first year. Our partnership focuses on three objectives:
            attack deforestation in the Amazon, strengthen the
            Caribbean&#x2019;s resilience to natural disasters, and
            bridge the digital-access gap across Latin America and the Caribbean.

            2023 G20 India Leaders Summit "One Future" Session
            held on September 10, 2023. He said that we face declining
            progress in our fight against poverty, an existential
            climate crisis, food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling
            pandemic recovery, widening disparity, and a crippling war
            on the borders of Europe. He congratulated Prime Minister
            Modi and all G20 Members on, puts the World Bank at the
            center of their search for solutions. He mentioned that to
            truly make a difference, we will need a greater appetite for
            risk, meaningful private sector financing, and a sense of
            urgency. He explained that the World Bank is working to
            expand concessional financing to help more low-income
            countries achieve their goals, while thinking creatively
            about how to encourage cooperation across borders and tackle
            shared challenges. He insisted on keeping focus on how many
            girls are in school, jobs created, and private sector
            dollars mobilized. He concluded by saying that, as we face a
            new era in development, the World Bank remain committed to
            creating a world free of poverty on a livable planet.

I think it takes a lot of hard work, a lot of knowledge, a lot of financing, and a lot of partnerships. Financing is the obvious one. We're talking about putting to work 50% more money per year than what we used to spend in healthcare pre the pandemic. This financing has to be catered for the country and its stage of development. In the same way, knowledge has to be catered for the country and its stage of development. We can bring that knowledge as a partner, not just our financing, not just our ability to advise governments on regulatory policy, but our ability to help even him understand the intersections between these different causes of healthcare problems and the intertwined challenges that we are going through.
